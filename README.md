<b>Main problems </b> : if you hide an entry, you can't see it in the portofolio, so you can't unhide it ( you can do it only trough data base edit ) 
<br />
If you want to edit an entry, if you don't type at least a space in every input, the value won't update, so it will send an empty object back.
